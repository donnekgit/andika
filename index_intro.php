For centuries, Swahili was written in Arabic script, and hundreds of manuscripts in collections around the world testify to its long tradition of written literature.  Over the last century, however, Swahili in Roman script has become the norm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Andika!</strong> (meaning <em>Write!</em> in Swahili) is a set of tools to make Swahili in Arabic script as easy to use as Swahili in Roman script - it is equally easy to read and write the the language in either script.   The tools, based on the work of Marehemu Mu'allim Sheikh Yahya Ali Omar <strong>[1]</strong>, provide a consistent, standardised transliteration of Swahili in Arabic script, and a one-to-one mapping of this to Swahili in Roman script.
