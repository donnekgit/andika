The spelling conventions suggested here for current-day Swahili reflect those developed by Marehemu Mu'allim Sheikh Yahya Ali Omar, and used in various manuscripts he wrote, along with the principles set out in the academic article he wrote in collaboration with PJL Frankl <strong>[1]</strong>.  This section sets out the main elements of my interpretation of these source, giving various examples.  I would be happy to hear from anyone who has any comments on the conventions.
