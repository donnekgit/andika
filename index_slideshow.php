The images in the slideshow give examples of various pieces of Swahili written in Arabic script.  The intention is to show that the <strong>Andika!</strong> tools can cope with a variety of different requirements - all the copies are transcribed letter-for-letter from the originals.

The word <strong>andika!</strong> (<em>write!</em>) is shown in various Arabic fonts, giving some idea of the variety and expressiveness of the script.  Virtually all of these fonts, however, have been designed for Arabic only, and need characters added to them before they are useable with Swahili.  See the <em>Fonts</em> tab in the <a href="./keyboard.php">Keyboard</a> section.

A <strong>copy</strong> of the specimen text (Appendix C) from the Omar/Frankl paper, which they included to show how their system would look in practice.  The text is a section from: Omar, YA (1998): <em>Three Prose Texts in the Swahili of Mombasa. Mit einer Einleitung von PJL Frankl.</em> Sprache und Oralität in Afrika, Frankfurter Studien zur Afrikanistik, Band 21. Berlin: Dietrich Reimer.

A section of the Swahili Wikipedia page on <a href="https://sw.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utamaduni"><span class="sm_swahili" style="color: #4D99E0;">أُتَمَدُونِ</span></a> (<strong>utamaduni</strong>, <em>culture</em>), converted using <strong>Andika!</strong> conventions - see the section <a href="http://andika/spelling.php"> Spelling conventions</a>.

A <strong>copy</strong> of the first few verses from a manuscript written by Sheikh Yahya himself, giving a transcription of Bajuni fishing songs. (See: Donnelly, K and Omar, YA (1982): “Structure and association in Bajuni fishing songs”. In: <em>Genres, Forms, Meanings: Essays in African Oral Literature</em>, edited by Veronika Görög-Karady, JASO Occasional Papers 1, Oxford.) The Arabic script in this manuscript differs in a number of minor respects from the one in the Omar/Frankl paper.  The Roman conversion in this case uses various diacritics to reconcile the manuscript's representation of the Bajuni dialect with standard orthography.  This close transcription (like the default standard transcription) is generated automatically, and can be made the default.  Further converters can be set up to reflect other transcription conventions.

A <strong>copy</strong> of verses 3-5 of: Harries, L (1967): <em>Utenzi wa Mkunumbi. A Swahili Potlatch – The Poem about Mkunumbi.</em> Nairobi: East African Literature Bureau.  This is one of the few books of Swahili classical poetry to include the text in Arabic script alongside the Roman transcription, in this case a photocopy of a copy of the original manuscript made by Sheikh Yahya. The Arabic script in this manuscript is less well-adapted to Swahili - for instance, <em>o</em> is not used consistently.  The Roman transcription is Harries' own - a generated close transcription might be:

dōla mbili ziliwāna * shikuwe nā simba mbawāna
kamaṯezo kushindāna * mṯāna nalayliyā
zikiṯimu siku ṯāṯu * shikuwe kaṯaka wāṯu
kuṯukuwa chāke kiṯu * nḡūbe kay nunuliyā
kaṯiya ngūbe ndiyāni * mema āsiyu lahāni
simba shı̄ kabaı̄ni * mpāni ngūbe mmuyā
</pre>
