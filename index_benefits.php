Swahili manuscripts in Arabic script can be directly transcribed and made available in digital format.  At present, most Swahili literature from earlier periods has only been published in Roman transliteration.  The third image in the slideshow above shows part of a manuscript rendering of Bajuni fishing songs, transcribed letter-for-letter from the manuscript.
</li>  

<li>
A direct transcription can be augmented with a fully-vocalised Arabic transcription, a close phonetic transliteration, a transliteration in the standard Roman orthography, and so on, according to taste.  The tools allow much of these to be generated automatically, reducing the effort this would otherwise involve.
</li>

<li>
Apart from allowing easier typesetting and dissemination, having manuscripts in digital form will make it possible for the first time to use computers to look at word frequency, stylistic variation, etc, within the texts, to build corpora for classical Swahili, and so on.
</li>

<li>
New writing in Swahili can be composed in Arabic script and published easily via word-processors, webpages, or pdfs created by typesetting systems such as LaTeX.
</li>

<li>
The ability to convert Arabic script at any time into Roman script means that there is very little overhead involved in choosing to write Swahili in Arabic script.  Material can be produced simultaneously in both scripts with the minimum of effort (although the converted text will need minor editing to cover such things as capital letters, which do not exist in Arabic script).
</li>

<li>
Existing Swahili content in Roman script can be converted to Arabic script, making it possible to reuse content already published in Roman script. This means that large amounts of material in Arabic script can be be made available very quickly - it is not necessary to create them specially.
</li>

<li>
The conversion tools include cut-and-paste boxes for small amounts of text, a Roman-to-Arabic converter for entire webpages, and offline converters for bulk conversion of text.
</li>

<li>
The Arabic-to-Roman conversion can be extended to provide a variety of different transliterations (eg <em>kh</em> or <em>x</em> for  <span class="sm_swahili">Ø®</span> instead of the standard <em>h</em>).
</li>

<li>
The Roman-to-Arabic conversion can be adjusted to convert numerals, to add or remove markers such as <em>sakani</em> (<em>sukun</em>), and so on.
</li>
